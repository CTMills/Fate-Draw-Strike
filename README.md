# Fate/Draw: Strike

## Overview

This is a TCG for the fate universe in which you take on another master with your servant in a deck you have perfected. Using features and servants from your favorite servants is what makes this game special. It is a solo indie development project that is made just to practice and gain experience within the Unity engine.

## Feature 1: Servants (0%)

The game revolves around summoning servants as your main unit or powerhouse of the deck. This game will use a mana system like most other TCGs with every servant costing the same mana to summon. Much like other TCGs, your servant will have a quest attached to them that you can complete to then upgrade them to their final form and unlock the use of their Holy Phantasm.

## Feature 2: Command Seals (0%)

A big part of the Fate universe is the idea of command seals. Typically denoted as 3 per servant summoned, a master had 3 commands that are to be performed by their servant with complete obedience. I intend to implement Command Seals as a way to act using instants in this game instead of the normal variation of having instant spells. That way you have to really think about the command seal cards (instants) you decide to play in a game.
